## About Me  

I am a **physicist, machine learning researcher, and PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Lowell**, specializing in **gravitational wave detection, astrophysics, and artificial intelligence applications in scientific computing**. My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning techniques for analyzing astrophysical signals, with a particular emphasis on deep learning methodologies for gravitational wave detection.  

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked with the **He6-CRES experiment at the University of Washington**, where I contributed to high-precision measurements in fundamental physics. I also conducted research at the **National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL)**, applying advanced microscopy and data-driven analysis to material characterization. In industry, I have worked in **nondestructive evaluation and computational imaging**, applying **ultrasonic testing, radiographic imaging, and machine learning** to aerospace materials and structural analysis.  

My broader interests lie at the intersection of **computational physics, large-scale data analysis, and high-performance computing**, with a focus on leveraging AI-driven approaches to explore complex physical systems. This website serves as a platform to highlight my research, projects, and professional contributions.
